# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

Today I learned about single page apps and client-side routing. I like the functionality of having different routes within a single page. It's quicker and enhances the user experience. Adding routes to my portfolio took a while because of all the restructuring and new files. My partner for the lab was Greg and he helped me make a sticky navy for my portfolio.
