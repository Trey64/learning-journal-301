# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

Today I learned about functional programming and using array methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. I also learned about arrow functions, which are great for their shorter syntax, but also too confusing for me at the moment. My partner for the lab was Zach and it was a challenge, especially when chaining array methods. It's been a quite a stressful week, but at least I have the weekend to relax and soak up all this new info.
