# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Today I learned about events in jQuery and using the .on() method to execute them. My partner for the lab was Erik. It was pretty tough and took us most of the afternoon. The solutions were typically just a few lines of code, but there are so many selectors and attributes that it took us some time for us to learn which ones to use and why. I liked writing the event handlers for tabs and teasers because those are cool features I could use for my portfolio.
