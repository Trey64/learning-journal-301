# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

Today I learned about building a form to create a new article, then appending it to the DOM with jQuery. With Sam being out sick, wrapping my head around everything was more difficult than usual. I was just clueless about what to do until I realized the video lectures from the previous class were in a playlist. After watching them and coding along, I was able to get a better understanding of the new information, but I'm still iffy.

The partner power hour was great, even though he wasn't here in person. Josh's methods for negotiating a salary were very practical and insightful. I have never negotiated salary before. In the military, you get what you get. Before that, I had just worked part-time jobs that had set wages. So I have no experience with that stuff, but I will definitely be using his site as a resource when I start landing job interviews!
