# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Today, I learned about the MVC and WRRC. It was cool using media queries to change how a page is displayed at different sizes. The lab was about implementing a mobile-first design and my partner was Gregory. We communicated well and knocked out the all TODO items in about an hour. The new GitHub and pair programming workflow took some getting used to.

Some other nifty things I learned about were icon fonts and using live-server in my terminal. So simple yet so convenient!
