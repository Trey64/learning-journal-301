# LJ Code 301 - Day 6

Today I learned about using AJAX and JSON to retrieve, cache, and load data. It's a big step forward, and I don't completely have my head wrapped around it yet. The lecture was probably the dryest one yet, in my opinion, and I may have missed some key concepts when my attention drifted. A code review tomorrow will definitely help me though.

Taking some time to check out the eclipse was pretty cool. It was fun and educational, even though it didn't pertain to code.
