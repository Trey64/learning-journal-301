# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

Today we did a review on various topics, like arrow functions and PageJS. Our Lunch & Learn was Jon Peck from Algorithmia. He had a lot of knowledge about using publicly-available APIs to make applications better. My project group is Zach, Gregory, and Brandon. Our project is an app that displays Seattle building permit info on a map. It's a great group and we're off to a strong start. We got a basic html structure with a nav bar and hero image, as well as a google map rendering on the page. Can't wait to build on it next week!
